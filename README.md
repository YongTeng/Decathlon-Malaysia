# Business Problem
The primary objectives of this influencer campaign, run by Decathlon's Domyos brand, were:
•	To rejuvenate its customer base by attracting Generation Z customers.
•	To assess the profitability of the campaign.
The aim was to use influencer marketing, specifically a live Instagram session by fitness influencer Sissy Mua, to appeal to younger audiences and increase Generation Z engagement with Decathlon's Cardio Fitness products.
Key questions to address:
•	Was the target of recruiting more Generation Z customers achieved?
•	Was the campaign profitable for Decathlon?

<p align="justify"> To conduct a focused analysis, we utilized five key datasets: d_customers, flow_audience, d_business_unit, d_sku, and f_transaction_detail. These datasets provided customer demographics, product interactions, store information, SKU-level product details, and transaction data. We narrowed down our scope by filtering for specific model codes (7635140, 5015822, 7166996, 2486222) representing the main products in the campaign—leggings, bra, t-shirt, and shoes. Each model code is associated with specific SKUs, creating a hierarchical structure that links SKUs as subcategories within their primary models. By merging filtered SKU and transaction data with customer information, we formed a comprehensive dataset that enables targeted analysis of customer engagement and purchasing patterns within the female sportswear market, providing insights into the campaign’s impact on this audience segment.![image]
